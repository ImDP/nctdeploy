          We're a team of innovators dedicated to helping governments and Central
          Banks explore a future with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Some of
          the things we do:

          While it's important to understand what we do, it's also important to
          know what we don't do. NCT is not in the business of making, creating,
          trading, distributing, investing or providing investment advice on crypto currencies,
          distributed ledger or blockchain. We're here to help Governments and Central Banks
          implement digital versions oftheir national currencies, "Central Bank Digital Currencies" often
          abbreviated "CBDC".
